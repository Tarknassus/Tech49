XFCE4 and GTK3 theme based on the UI from Oblivion.  

Custom UI theme for Sublime Text based on the Oblivion FUI from 
[GMUNK](http://work.gmunk.com/OBLIVION-GFX)

The structure for this is very closely based on the 
[Phoenix Theme](https://github.com/netatoo/phoenix-theme) which is based off of 
[Soda Dark](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme).
